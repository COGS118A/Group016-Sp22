    "We are going to use regression to obtain the weight (parameter) of each factor impacting housing prices using the training dataset and then predict housing prices with these parameters. In detail, we will first set up a loss function with approriate regularization for the training set, and then try to minimize the loss function though gradient descent. The weight vector that minimizes the loss function is just want we need."

In this case it would be the proportion of K-complex and Spindles labeled correctly. This would simply be the number of images labeled correctly divided by the number of images."
    "\n"
    "Another common classification metric would be to maximize the area under the ROC curve. By maximizing the area under the ROC curve. Because area under the curve corresponds to how good the model is, maximizing ROC-AUC could be another potential metric evaluation. We considered the ROC as a potential metric because it would give use the opportunity to visualize thresholds and the proportion of false negatives to false positives the model makes."

    "The data used in this project come from human participants. However, this project doesn’t use any personally identifiable information nor does it require any further human participation. Also, the data used in the original EEG experiment involved informed consent and is permitted to be used non-commercially."
    "\n"
    "We did not label the data and are unable to determine whether the data was correctly labeled. One way that could help this issue would be to look at other examples of K-complexes and Spindles and compare to see whether they look similar to the corresponding labeled images. An issue with this is we would be slightly unconfident in identifying the correct labels for certain images due to a lack of expertise."
    "\n"
    "Because our data will be images, there is a worry about the “curse of dimensionality”. However, we’re confident that we will still be able to get good training sets because of the abundance of data available to counteract the lower proportional representation."
    "\n"
    "One issue arises from the fact that our model will not predict with 100 percent accuracy. If the model is used for K-complex and Spindle classification, the class prediction of an image would still need to be verified by a human. The problem arises when this verification is ignored and the prediction of the model is taken as absolutely correct. Not only could this impact the results of studies, but also the waste of resources that go into those studies. Some ways to counter this would be to run classification on the images with multiple models and use the majority classification across the models which could help make more accurate predictions. We could also be transparent about our results and inform users that the model isn’t perfect and the results require verification. In the worst case scenario we will recall the entire algorithm"
