    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",

    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our project is going to be revolved around housing prices in California. We hope to predict and evaluate future housing prices based on various factors. The data sets used represents the housing price trends from the 1990 census. There are ten variables considered into the relationship with California housing prices: longitude, latitude, housingMedianAge, median age of a house within a block; totalRooms, total number of rooms within a block; totalBedrooms, total number of bedrooms within a block; population, households, total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block; medianIncome, median income for households within a block of houses; medianHouseValue, median house value for households within a block, and oceanProximity. Adding on, we are also using other datasets that can potentially contribute to the rise of housing prices such as crime rates, natural disasters, demographic, scarcity of housing, etc. We will be using machine learning algorithms to conduct trend studies and to filter through neccessary data. Using these data, we will be able to see a trend and be able to predict if housing prices will increase or decrease and if other factors will affect that change. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict what factors play a role in housing prices in all of California. Supply and demand obviously are deterministic of current prices, but we want to explore the climate of prices as they pertain to housing location. Location data needs to be at least as granular as the size of counties to produce meaningful comparisons among locations. Then, what attributes of location influence housing prices? Factors we can look at must vary by location, for example, ethnic data from census, proximity to coastline, crime and natural disasters, etc. As long as the datasets have a magnitude and location, the values can be mapped to (or nearby to) the housing location and compared to the houses' prices. Given so many variables that may affect housing prices, we need to be very cautious about which we choose to observe to maintain the integrity of our analysis."

    "When training the model, one potential evaluation metric we could use would be to take the absolute value of the difference between the predicted price and actual price for each house and sum these differences to get an evaluation value. By using this as our evaluation metric, an evaluation value of 0 would indicate that the model performed perfectly and was able to predict all housing prices correctly. On the other hand, a large evaluation value would indicate that the model performed poorly and the predicted housing prices are incorrect."

    "The data used in this project does not include human participants which removes some ethical issues such as informed consent, exposure of personally identifiable information, and more. However, because we plan to use pre-collected data from sites such as “Kaggle”, we are unsure whether there was any collection bias when the data was collected. One way to help mitigate this issue would be to look for similar data and compare to determine whether the data is consistent across data. We also plan to use data from multiple sources/datasets and need to make sure that data from these different datasets are usable together. For example, if one dataset looks at housing prices in California for 2022, we can’t use a dataset for crime rate in California that isn’t from 2022 because that could be misrepresentative.\n",

    "One unintended use could arise when purchasing and selling houses. The goal of this project is to predict housing prices, not to determine what the housing prices should be. It’s probable that people looking to buy or sell housing will look at these predicted prices to determine what houses are overpriced, whether or not to raise the price of a current house, and other situations that would affect the sale or purchase of a house. A couple of solutions would be to inform users that the predicted price does not determine the value of a house or to completely rollback the project entirely."
